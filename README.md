# GateFinder

GateFinder is a framework to allow a more simple interaction between user and the Silicon Quantum Atomic Simulator in applications that require multiple modifications in a design and exhaustive invocations of simulation runs, using the engine simAnneal of SiQAD. Full and detailed documentation is still pending, but here you can find the following folders:

- src/ : containing the source codes of all the classes created, and examples of scripts that use those classes for design edition and simulation (gatefinder.py; gatefinder_guiless.py) and for performing error analysis (errorAnalysis.py), using the Sequential Model of error insertion.

- designs/ : containing some .sqd designs used to test the framework's features

- examples/ : containing examples of the first demo version of the framework, developed and presented for the Nanocomputing course at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, in 2021.

- article/ : a brief article explaining the framework's first version. This is a little old and will be updated soon.

- UML_diagrams/ : containing the most updated version of UML diagrams for the framework.
